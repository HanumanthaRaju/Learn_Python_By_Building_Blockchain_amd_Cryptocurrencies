## Adding classes to blockchain

We create a **block.py** that will have a class Block, with constructor.

We save custom class object via json

We create transaction.py that will have a class Transaction, with constructor

We create verificaion.py file that will have a verification class

We initialize the node class, which is a user interface class

We create a Blockchain class
