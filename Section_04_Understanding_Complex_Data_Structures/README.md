## Choosing the right data structure: Refer to the Transaction, A Block and Manging List of Participants above
 For Transaction: We need Key value pair, we require Dictionary
 
 For List of transactions: We need List
 
 For Blockchain itself: We need List
 
 For Block: Dictionary
 
 For List of participants: Set, for storing unique values

## Transactions with Dictionaries and tuples

## Improved blockchain Validation logic 

![outcome](./17.JPG)

Define new function hash_block(), mine_block() call hasH_block(last_block), update the code in verify_chain()
