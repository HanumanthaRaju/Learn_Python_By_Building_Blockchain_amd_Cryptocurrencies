## Choosing the right data structure: Refer to the Transaction, A Block and Manging List of Participants above
 For Transaction: We need Key value pair, we require Dictionary
 
 For List of transactions: We need List
 
 For Blockchain itself: We need List
 
 For Block: Dictionary
 
 For List of participants: Set, for storing unique values
