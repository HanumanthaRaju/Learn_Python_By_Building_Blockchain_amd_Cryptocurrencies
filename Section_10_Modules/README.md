# Working with Modules and Third-party Packages: Splitting up Responsibilities

We create Custom module bundles, Advanced module operations, Installing and using Third-Party Packages

For Blockchain: We add a basic wallet

## Creating packages module bundles

We create a helper package

Understand module docstring

Understand how to control what can be exported

Activate the python package environment in VS.

run the coomands

source activate python

or 

activate python

### Generating keys with third party package

Remember to run your project in the new Environment you have created.

Create a **Wallet.py** file

### Connecting node and wallet

### Generating keys on the node

### Saving and loading keys to files

### Creating transaction signatures

### add signature to transactions

### verify signatures

### Improve verification logic

### Summary
